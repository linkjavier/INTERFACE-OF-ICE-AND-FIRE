# Interface of Ice and Fire

This is a web application built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript that allows users to explore the houses and characters from the "A Song of Ice and Fire" series. The application fetches data from the [A Song of Ice and Fire API](https://anapioficeandfire.com/) and displays it in a user-friendly interface.
